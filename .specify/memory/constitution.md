# Financial Narrative Analyzer (FNA) Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Analysis
Every feature must leverage AI/ML capabilities for financial text analysis. All text processing pipelines MUST use fine-tuned language models optimized for financial narratives. Manual text analysis is prohibited - automated sentiment, tone, and risk detection is non-negotiable for core functionality.

**Rationale**: The product's core value proposition depends on AI-powered insights that humans cannot efficiently extract from large volumes of financial text at scale.

### II. Data Accuracy & Reliability
All ML models MUST achieve minimum 85% accuracy on tone classification tasks. Correlation analysis between sentiment shifts and financial metrics MUST maintain >0.4 correlation coefficient. Model performance MUST be continuously monitored with automated accuracy regression detection.

**Rationale**: Financial analysis requires high confidence thresholds since incorrect sentiment analysis can lead to poor investment decisions with significant monetary impact.

### III. Performance Optimization
Report processing time MUST remain under 60 seconds per document. LLM inference MUST use quantized models (4-bit GGUF preferred) and embedding caching to minimize cost and latency. Database queries MUST be optimized for sub-200ms response times at expected user scales.

**Rationale**: Real-time financial analysis requires rapid processing to maintain competitive advantage in time-sensitive market conditions.

### IV. API-First Design
Every analytical capability MUST be exposed via REST API endpoints with standardized JSON responses. Web interface features MUST be built on top of public APIs - no direct database access from frontend. All APIs MUST support rate limiting and authentication for enterprise integration.

**Rationale**: Financial platforms require programmatic integration capabilities, and API-first ensures consistency between web UI and external integrations.

### V. Scalability & Cost Management
Infrastructure MUST support horizontal scaling with container orchestration. LLM inference costs MUST be minimized through model quantization, request batching, and intelligent caching. Database design MUST partition large datasets for efficient querying at enterprise scale.

**Rationale**: Financial data volumes grow exponentially, and cost-effective scaling is essential for sustainable business operations across SMB to enterprise segments.

## Technical Standards

**Language Stack**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI for backend services, React 18+ with Tailwind CSS for frontend
**ML Framework**: Transformers library with quantized models (Mistral 7B, Phi-3-mini), ChromaDB or FAISS for vector storage
**Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured data, MinIO for document storage, Redis for caching
**Performance Requirements**: <60s document processing, <200ms API response times, >99% uptime
**Security Standards**: API authentication, rate limiting, data encryption at rest and in transit
**Monitoring**: Structured logging, model accuracy tracking, performance metrics collection

## Development Workflow

**Test-First Development**: All ML model changes MUST include accuracy regression tests before implementation
**Code Review Gates**: All PRs require accuracy validation, performance impact assessment, and security review
**Deployment Pipeline**: Staged deployment with model A/B testing in production before full rollout
**Documentation Requirements**: API documentation, model performance benchmarks, and operational runbooks
**Quality Gates**: Accuracy thresholds, performance SLAs, and security compliance checks before production

## Governance

Constitution compliance is verified in all code reviews and deployment gates. Model accuracy below thresholds triggers immediate investigation and potential rollback. Performance regressions require mitigation plan before further development. All principle violations MUST be documented with business justification and approval from technical leadership.

For runtime development guidance, refer to project documentation in `/docs/` and implementation specifications in `/specs/`.
