# Feature Specification: Financial Narrative Analyzer Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-fna-platform`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Financial Narrative Analyzer platform for reading, interpreting, and comparing narrative tone and strategic messaging in corporate financial reports"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Analyze Financial Reports (Upload or Auto-Download) (Priority: P1)

An equity analyst either uploads a company's latest 10-K filing or searches for it by company ticker to automatically download from SEC.gov, then quickly assesses management sentiment and identifies potential red flags before making investment recommendations.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - provides immediate sentiment analysis that forms the foundation for all other features. Essential MVP functionality with automated data acquisition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by either uploading a report or entering a company ticker to auto-download, then receiving a sentiment analysis report with tone classification and key themes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user enters a company ticker symbol, **When** they request the latest filing, **Then** the system automatically downloads the most recent 10-K or 10-Q from SEC.gov and processes it within 60 seconds
2. **Given** a user uploads a financial report file, **When** they submit it via the dashboard, **Then** the system processes it and displays sentiment analysis within 60 seconds  
3. **Given** a processed report (uploaded or downloaded), **When** the user views the analysis, **Then** they see tone classification (positive/neutral/negative/uncertain) and key narrative themes
4. **Given** an unsupported file format on upload, **When** the user attempts upload, **Then** the system displays a clear error message with supported formats (PDF, HTML, TXT, iXBRL)

### User Story 2 - Compare Narrative Changes Over Time (Priority: P2)

A fund manager compares sentiment and messaging between a company's current and previous quarterly reports to identify strategic shifts or emerging risks, using either uploaded files or automatically downloaded reports from SEC.gov.

**Why this priority**: Differentiating feature that provides unique insight into narrative evolution - key competitive advantage over basic sentiment analysis tools.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by analyzing two reports from the same company (uploaded or auto-downloaded) and generating a narrative delta report showing changes in tone and themes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two or more reports from the same company, **When** the user requests comparison, **Then** the system generates a Narrative Delta Score showing sentiment change percentage
2. **Given** compared reports, **When** viewing the delta analysis, **Then** the system highlights new themes added, themes removed, and changes in risk language
3. **Given** significant narrative changes detected, **When** the analysis completes, **Then** the system displays alerts for major tone shifts (>15% change threshold)

---

### User Story 3 - Dashboard Visualization and Trends (Priority: P3)

A retail investor views interactive charts showing sentiment trends across multiple reporting periods to understand long-term company trajectory.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user experience and data comprehension but requires basic analysis functionality to be meaningful.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing timeline visualizations and trend charts for companies with multiple processed reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple reports processed for a company, **When** the user accesses the dashboard, **Then** they see timeline charts of sentiment scores over time
2. **Given** dashboard data, **When** the user interacts with visualizations, **Then** they can drill down into specific reporting periods and view detailed analysis
3. **Given** portfolio companies tracked, **When** significant changes occur, **Then** the alert system notifies users of important narrative shifts

---

### User Story 4 - API Access for Integration (Priority: P4)

A research firm integrates FNA sentiment data into their existing investment research platform via programmatic interface to supplement their analysis workflows.

**Why this priority**: Enables business scalability and enterprise adoption but requires core analysis functionality to provide value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making programmatic requests to retrieve sentiment scores, delta metrics, and key excerpts for processed reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** integration credentials, **When** a client makes authenticated requests, **Then** they receive structured data responses with sentiment analysis results
2. **Given** bulk analysis needs, **When** multiple reports are submitted programmatically, **Then** the system processes them asynchronously and provides status updates
3. **Given** integration requirements, **When** data responses are returned, **Then** they include tone scores, delta metrics, key excerpts, and confidence levels

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a report contains no meaningful narrative sections (only financial tables)?
- How does the system handle reports in languages other than English?
- What occurs when uploaded files are corrupted or password-protected?
- How does the system respond when analysis confidence is below acceptable thresholds?
- What happens when comparing reports from different industries with varying disclosure standards?
- What occurs when SEC.gov is temporarily unavailable or rate-limits requests?
- How does the system handle invalid or non-existent company ticker symbols?
- What happens when the requested company has no recent filings available?
- How does the system process iXBRL files that have malformed or incomplete structured data?
- What occurs when automatic downloads fail due to network connectivity issues?
