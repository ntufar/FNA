# Tasks: Financial Narrative Analyzer Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-fna-platform/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/` (per plan.md structure)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 models but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1/US2 data but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Exposes existing functionality via API

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints  
- Backend implementation before frontend components
- Core functionality before integration and UI
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task T022: "Create User model with authentication in backend/src/models/user.py"
Task T023: "Create Company model with ticker validation in backend/src/models/company.py"
Task T024: "Create FinancialReport model with processing status in backend/src/models/financial_report.py" 
Task T025: "Create NarrativeAnalysis model with multi-dimensional scores in backend/src/models/narrative_analysis.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Tasks T001-T011)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Tasks T012-T021) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Tasks T022-T042)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Tasks T022-T042)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Tasks T043-T051)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Tasks T052-T065)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Tasks T066-T076)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

- **US2**: Compare two reports ‚Üí view narrative delta analysis
- **US3**: Access dashboard ‚Üí view trend charts and manage alerts
- **US4**: Make API calls ‚Üí receive structured data and process batches

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Complete Phases 1-3 only (Tasks T001-T042) - 42 tasks total
- Core functionality: Upload reports, auto-download from SEC, multi-dimensional analysis
- Essential features: User authentication, company management, sentiment analysis
- Ready for market validation with core value proposition

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
